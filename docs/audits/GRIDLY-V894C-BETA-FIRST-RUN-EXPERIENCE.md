# GRIDLY V894C — Beta First Run Experience

## Objective

Provide a lightweight, friendly, skippable **Quick Tour** for beta testers so the first run feels like a welcome experience instead of documentation.

## V894C2 polished Quick Tour behavior

- The visible first action row now offers **Skip** and **Start Tour**.
- The tour uses **Quick Tour** language instead of visible walkthrough copy.
- The opening message is short and user-facing: **Welcome to Gridly**, **Know Before You Go.**, and “Gridly helps you see what’s happening nearby before you leave.”
- Bullet-heavy setup documentation was replaced with compact visual cards.
- Each card focuses on one idea:
  - **Know Before You Go** — “Check your quick briefing before heading out.”
  - **Map** — “See nearby reports, crossings, hazards, and conditions.”
  - **Alerts** — “Open Alerts to see active reports in one place.”
  - **Report** — “See something? Submit a report to help others.”
  - **Search** — “Search a destination before you go.”
  - **You’re Ready** — “Thanks for helping test Gridly.”
- **Finish** is clearly visible after the cards and persists completion.
- The optional location/watch-area setup remains available without changing reporting, alerts, hazard lifecycle, Route Watch, awareness filtering, weather, or Supabase behavior.

## V894C3 mobile portrait scroll fix

- The Quick Tour sheet and card now use viewport-safe maximum heights so the modal fits within mobile portrait screens.
- The inner Quick Tour content area scrolls vertically when the cards, Finish action, and optional watch-area setup exceed the available height.
- **Skip** and **Start Tour** remain in the visible action row, while **Finish** remains reachable inside the scrollable content area without clipping at the bottom.
- The background app can remain dimmed/blurred; this update only changes first-run Quick Tour layout and scrolling.
- V894C1/V894C2 completion, reset, skip, finish, and Settings replay behavior are preserved.

## Corrected V894C1 state model retained

- The canonical completion source is `gridlyBetaFirstRunWalkthroughCompleteV894C`.
- `getGridlyFirstRunCompletionStorageKey()` returns the canonical completion source, and `isGridlyFirstRunWalkthroughComplete()` is the shared completion detector.
- Skip, Finish, and setup completion all call the same persisted completion path, so first-run completion is stored once instead of partially synchronized across welcome/setup keys.
- Legacy welcome/setup completion keys are treated as orphan-prone compatibility keys and are cleared when completion is stored or reset.
- The legacy `gridlyWelcomeSeenV1` key is no longer written as a parallel completion source.
- A fresh user has no canonical completion value, so the Quick Tour appears.
- **Skip** marks the canonical walkthrough completion source and the Quick Tour does not appear again.
- **Finish** marks the canonical walkthrough completion source and the Quick Tour does not appear again.
- Finish/setup completion through location or manual area setup still marks the same canonical source.
- **Show walkthrough again** from Settings resets the canonical completion source, clears welcome/setup completion state owned by the tour, and then reopens the tour.
- `window.gridlyResetFirstRunWalkthrough?.()` uses the same reset path and fully restores first-run tour state.

## Runtime behavior

- The Quick Tour uses local device storage only.
- Completion is stored under `gridlyBetaFirstRunWalkthroughCompleteV894C`.
- The first-run open path checks the canonical completion source before opening, so the tour appears only when incomplete.
- Opening is scheduled with `requestAnimationFrame`, allowing the core app shell to render first.
- The tour can be skipped, finished, completed through setup, or restarted from Settings with the **Show walkthrough again** action.

## V894C compatibility coverage

The polished Quick Tour keeps the V894C coverage intent while simplifying the presentation: `Know Before You Go / Awareness Brief`, `Map`, `Alerts`, `Report`, `Search`, and `Awareness area / Home area` remain covered by the tour, optional watch-area setup, and Settings replay path.

## Protected systems

No Supabase schema, hazard lifecycle, alert generation, awareness filtering, Route Watch logic, report acceptance logic, clearing logic, weather logic, or protected system behavior was changed. This is a presentation-only Quick Tour polish and mobile scroll update that preserves V894C1 completion and reset behavior.

## V894C4 final Quick Tour mobile polish

- The Quick Tour card now uses a bounded mobile portrait shell with a dedicated inner scroll region so the card list, Finish action, and optional location/home-area setup scroll inside the first-run card instead of being clipped by the modal shell.
- The inner Quick Tour region is explicitly audit-detectable with scroll/no-clipping markers and keeps mobile momentum scrolling, safe-area bottom padding, scroll padding, and per-card scroll margins so cards are not partially hidden at the top or bottom of the scroll range.
- The former persistent `Start Tour` link now presents a non-confusing `Tour Below` state while the tour cards are already visible, while Skip remains reachable in the top action row and Finish remains reachable near the final tour card.
- Skip and Finish still use the existing V894C completion persistence paths, and the optional Use My Location/manual watch-area setup remains available after the Finish action.

Expected final audit booleans:

- `quickTourScrollEnabled: true`
- `noQuickTourContentClipping: true`
- `quickTourActionsReachable: true`
- `startTourNotConfusingDuringTour: true`
- `finishReachable: true`
- `protectedSystemsUnchanged: true`
- `safeForBeta: true`
